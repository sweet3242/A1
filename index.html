											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi, my name is Anna I am turning 21 this year. Since graduating high school I have been working in a customer facing role at a bank. I enjoy cooking in my spare time and trying foods from other cuisines. I am also an aquarium hobbyist and love to keep fish. </p>

									<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
									<p1>I became interested in IT as a potential career path as it is such a broad field and there are many areas that I could foray into. I do not have that much practical knowledge in IT.  However, my father works in the IT sector and I can see that he really enjoys his job. He encouraged me to try out some  IT courses to see if it would suit me as well.
                  <br> I chose RMIT as this course was flexible enough to allow me to work during the weekdays. I am also looking at enrolling in the Bachelor of IT once I finish the foundation subjects.
                  <br> Through this course I hope to learn some practical skills in coding and also get a better idea of what pathways there are in IT.

									<p><b>UX Designer</b></p>
									<p> <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57388794?type=standard#sol=d8482522dbd92c3b743add55bab96c9752b6d1b1">Job Listing on Seek</a></p>
                  <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/job.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					        <h3><b>Role Description</b></h3>
							   	<p1>
                   My ideal job is to be a UX designer.  They are responsible for shaping the usability and experience of a digital interface to ensure it meets both the needs of the customer and the business.
                   UX design  involves aspects of interaction design,  business analysis , marketing and psychology.  The reason I am attracted to this role is because I have an interest in visual communication. I believe the design aspects of the role would suit my creative side. </p1>
               		<h3> <b>Skills and Responsibilities</b></h3>
								  <p1>UX designers are required to have a good working knowledge of design and functionality. They are expected to know how to use programs such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Figma, Sketch and UXPin. It also helps to be familiar with html, CSS and JavaScript.
										<br>  Tasks undertaken by UX designers include:
<br> - Consulting with Stakeholders.
<br> - Usability Testing.
<br> - Analyzing research results and user feedback.
<br> - Creating  storyboards, wireframes and prototypes.
</p1>

								  <h3><b>My Plan</b></h3>
				         	<p1>I will look at becoming familiar with programs  that are commonly used by UX designers such as Adobe CC and Figma. I will also aim to increase my knowledge by conducting research about design and usability. I will then start to build a design portfolio that I can use to apply for entry level UX jobs to gain experience.</p1>

									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									<h4> <b>MBTI:</b>  INTP <br>
<b>Learning Style:</b>  Visual Learner <br>
<b> Big Five Personality Test Ranking: </b>  1. Agreeableness 2. Openness 3. Neuroticism 4. Conscientiousness 5. Extraversion </h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/intp.png" alt="" /></span>These results suggest that I am quite introverted, intuitive and independent. My learning style is visual which I feel makes sense as I do have an affinity for art and design. Some aspects of my personality that are not as strong seem to be my organizational skills as well as my social skills.  I think these results are fairly accurate as I would consider myself introverted and lost in my own though most of the time. </p>
<p>
Although my results indicate that I am introverted, I am also quite agreeable. Due to this, I would easily be able to collaborate well with others, and pull my weight for the task.  However, I may have issues with asking for help from other team members when I need it.  I may also easily concede to others rather than  backing my own perspective or ideas.
</p>
<p> Keeping these results in mind, I believe I should aim to speak up and contribute my own ideas and opinions when I am in a team. I should also aim to  frequently get in touch with my other team members to update and help each other out. I believe this would also help foster a better team environment where everyone feels supported. Another objective that I will work on, is to lay out  clear goals and a timeline for a project both as a team and individually. This will ensure that I am on top of tasks and know what I am doing. </p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>


							</section>
								<section id="content" class="main">
									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p1>My project proposal is to develop an app that allows users to swap plants, produce and seedlings. It is aimed at plant enthusiasts and horticulturists. It allows them to conveniently find others in their local area who are also looking to swap or give away plants.

</p1>

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p1>The reason I wanted to develop this app was because I enjoy growing house plants and various succulents. However, it can be quite an expensive hobby as buying many plants from a nursery can be pricey. In addition to this, some plants are hard to find  in local nurseries and need to be shipped.  The app provides a platform for users to trade plants/seedlings/propagations so people can exchange what they have to gain new plants.
</p1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p1>Users sign up to create their own profile, under which they are able to list the plants they are willing to swap. Users are able to see other members that are close to them and their listings. They are also able to search for specific listings. Once a user finds a plant listing that they desire, they can send a request through to swap for one of their own plants. The member who receives the swap request can choose to decline it or accept it. If they accept the request, this will allow the users to message either  to proceed further with the trade. <br>
<b> Main Features of the App: </b>

</p1>
<ul>
	<li>Individual Profiles: Users would sign up to become members and create their user profile, which includes a username, profile photo and their general location. The profile page would show pictures of the plant listings that they have available to swap. Users will be able to view the profiles of others to see what they have available as well.
</li>
	<li>Map: The app will feature a map allowing users to see other members of the community that are nearby their vicinity.</li>
	<li>Catalogue and Search: The catalogue would allow users to post their listing under the relevant category. The search function would allow users to find listings that they are after by using keywords.
</li>
	<li>Messaging: After a request for a swap  has been accepted. Users are able to message each other to organize the specifics.
</li>
<li> Forums: Where members can post what they are looking for or other general queries. This can be classed under specific categories such as 'succulents' or 'plant identification'.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p1> <b> Front End:</b> An initial wireframe for the app will be made to flesh out the basic features and format of the app. This can be done using programs such as Sketch. Adobe CC can be used to create the design element of the app that include logos, images, designs of screens. ReactJS and AngularJS can be utilized to assist with creating the user interface.
<br><b> Back End: </b>The app can be developed more easily using an app builder tool such as WIX.  However, this may limit its functionality and so it may be more beneficial to develop from scratch using a free software development kit like Android Studio.
<br> <b> Server:</b> The app will need to be hosted on a server such as Azure or Google Cloud. </p1>

<h2>Skills Required
</h2>
<p1> To build this app, proficient skills would be needed in programming languages like html, css , javascript and java. In addition to this, the successful  creation of this app would also require good design skills and data analysis skills. This would most likely be a large undertaking for an individual and would be accomplished better by a team that includes app designers, front-end developers and back-end developers.

</p1>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p1>This app facilitates the trade of plants, while also helping to connect a community with a shared passion. I believe the app will have a dedicated number of users who are hobbyists and enjoy expanding their inventories. This will help them do so in a way that also benefits each other.
